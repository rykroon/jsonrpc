some how I just learned (or relearned) that there is a v2 of the json package. Wish I had
remembered that before putting in like 2 weeks of work into this project.

Looks like there is a jsontext.Value struct that replces json.RawMessage
I was considering creating my own JsonValue struct with some helper methods
attached, and funny enough this new jsontext.Value has all of that.

I think what I'll do is Ill make Id and Params a type alias of Value.

And then Wherever neccesary I'll just do checks to make sure that the value is of the correct type.
