Id and Params are both similar and different in a couple of ways

Both can be of a range of json types.
- An id can be an integer or a string (in some cases null)
- params can be an array, an object, or omitted

Both are different in the sense that an ID is part of a request AND a response,
while params are only for requests.

With an ID, it can only be int, string, or omitted from a request,
for responses, it can an int, string, or null.
